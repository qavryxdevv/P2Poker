//! One hand, as a state machine with no network in it.
//!
//! Bytes in, bytes out, and no `async` anywhere — the same shape as
//! [`net::formation`](crate::net::formation), and for the same reason: a state
//! machine that owns a socket can only be tested by standing up a socket, and
//! the defect that matters here is *two peers disagreeing*, which needs two
//! copies of the state and no network at all.
//!
//! # What this does today
//!
//! Stage 0 of hand `k`: `HAND_INIT`, a **collective** stage. Every seat in `R`
//! derives the same twelve fields, signs them, and sends them; every seat
//! recomputes what the others sent and compares field by field; the stage
//! completes when every seat in `R` has been heard, and its hash becomes the
//! parent of stage 1.
//!
//! `HAND_INIT` announces nothing and decides nothing — every field is a pure
//! function of the state before it (`PROTOCOL.md` §4.3), which is exactly why
//! nobody has a veto over the hand starting.
//!
//! # What it does not do yet, said plainly
//!
//! * The **RNG beacon** (`RNG_COMMIT` / `RNG_REVEAL`, §7.9) that decides the
//!   seat permutation and the initial button. Until it exists,
//!   [`provisional_button`] stands in: deterministic, agreed by everybody,
//!   and **not** the normative rule. It is one function so the beacon replaces
//!   it in one place.
//! * Everything after stage 0: the deck, the shuffle chain, the betting. The
//!   slot for stage 1 is computed and handed back, which is where that work
//!   starts.
